# Goldbach-Conjecture
A program to prove the correctness of Goldbach's Conjecture

Goldbach's Conjecture is a well-known and longstanding hypothesis in number theory, first proposed by the Prussian mathematician Christian Goldbach in 1742. The conjecture asserts that:
Every even integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two prime numbers.
This statement has been tested extensively and holds true for all even integers up to 
4 * 1000000000000000000
 , but it remains unproven for all even integers.
Historical Context
Goldbach initially articulated a broader conjecture in a letter to Leonhard Euler, suggesting that every integer greater than 2 can be represented as the sum of three primes. However, Euler reformulated this into what is now known as the "strong" or "binary" Goldbach conjecture, focusing specifically on even numbers.
Related Conjectures
There are two main forms of Goldbach's conjecture:
Strong Goldbach Conjecture: Every even integer greater than 2 is the sum of two primes.
Weak Goldbach Conjecture: Every odd integer greater than 5 can be expressed as the sum of three primes.
The weak conjecture has been proven, while the strong conjecture remains one of the oldest unsolved problems in mathematics.
Statistical Support
Despite the lack of a formal proof, statistical analyses and computational verifications suggest that the conjecture is likely true. As numbers grow larger, the number of ways they can be expressed as sums of primes increases, making it more probable that such representations exist.
Current Status
Efforts to prove Goldbach's conjecture continue, with many mathematicians believing it to be true based on empirical evidence rather than formal proof. Various computational methods have confirmed its validity for a vast range of even numbers, yet a definitive proof remains elusive.
In summary, Goldbach's Conjecture represents a significant challenge in mathematics, bridging historical inquiry with modern computational techniques to explore the properties of prime numbers and their relationships.
